intro: |
   Hello, My name is Uday Lokhande. Professionally, I have significant experience working <b>across a range of Cyber Security</b> activities, including a strong background of <b>Risk assessment</b> for projects, third party, applications to compliance for the organisation. I have a good grasp of the frameworks such as <b>ISO 27001, PCI-DSS</b> and had multiple opportunities to get the organisations certified by handling end to end activities involved in the process.</br></br>
   Personally, I enjoy working on shell scripts for Automation and Forensically Investigating Cyber Security Incidents to uncover the real <b>intent</b> of an attack/Hack. I like the Automation approach wherever it is possible to implement and promote the DevSecOps culture whenever I get an opportunity to do so. </br></br> <b>Dedicating my</b> efforts towards literature to understand the <b>root cause of Cyber Security events and Hackers perspective/behaviour</b> is a passion of mine.  <b>I also hold myself to a high standard when it comes listening to a problem statement and working to deliver the right solution/practice for my clients</b>.</br></br> 
   I have worked on my <a href="https://www.github.com/udayom" target="_blank">GitHub Profile</a> to provide an overview of my <b>career history and expertise</b> here. You can also find more information here on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udayom/" taget="_blank">LinkedIn Profile</a>

   Uday, Nicknamed U-DAY, (sometimes oM), also takes immense interest in going creative. I also have a great leaning towards Yoga🧘‍♂️, swimming🏊🏻‍♂️ and meditation🙇🏻 and health🩺. I have tried many custom-made plans for getting leaner from a diet and exercise perspective and am always happy to share them if the topic comes up. If you need any advice, or consultation or would like to chat/connect with me, feel free to do so on my given social accounts in the Additional Information section. </br> 
   Be it related to Fitness, health, Yoga, Astrology or just a Science talk like Netflix show Rick and Morty, I would love to talk 🗣️ more or share knowledge 🤓 over a Coffee ☕️.  </br></br>
